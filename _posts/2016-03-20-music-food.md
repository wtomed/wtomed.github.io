Over the past century or so, Americans have lost basic musical skill. Music has become a commodity, a consumer good, and the majority of us feel little need to actually sing or play.

The transformation of music into a commodity is due to industrialization. Lots of things have become industrialized in the past century, and for the most part, it's been a good thing for rich western societies.

Take food. Used to be, feeding yourself and your family was the main task anyone had to undertake to survive. It took up most of your time, required many forgotten skills, and was unreliable. You and your loved ones would starve from time to time, sometimes fatally.

Nowadays, thanks to industry, food is reliable, easily available, and cheap. We don't have to live under constant stress and fear of hunger, and we don't have to spend most of our days struggling to accumulate enough calories. No more heart rending cries from hungry children.

With abundant, cheap food, we no longer need lots of skill and time. Not many people remember how to raise it, and most of us don't really know how to cook.

Something similar happened with music. The quality and quantity of excellent content has led to a loss of skill. Why bother making music, when it's everywhere, performed by genius level professionals?

The industrialization of food, as good as it's been, has had some serious side effects. High quality food is easily available at the grocery store, but there's also a lot of horrific junk. The junk, essentially, has made many of us sick, with obesity, diabetes, heart disease, you name it, being the result.

These side effects have led to much push back. Farmers' markets, organic food, cooking shows - Rachel Ray! - all oriented towards giving food power to the people, the skills to give us the power to control what we put into our bodies. Now at least we have choices, unlike the bad old days of nothing but wonder bread and red delicious apples.

There has been push back against the industrialization of music as well, as much as it still dominates. Such as:

  * Lots of production and distribution channels. The industry would really prefer to go back to having a small number of massive, fat pipes.
  * Lots of growth in music equipment manufacturing and sales. I recently bought a brand new tenor banjo from [Deering Banjo](http://www.deeringbanjos.com/). I don't remember anything like this being available a few decades back. You could find a luthier somewhere, or buy an antique, but there wasn't enough of a market to support a manufacturer. BTW it was inexpensive, and is a beautiful piece of work.
  * Karoke. Some of my musician friends consider karaoke to be an abomination from the inner circles of hell. Not me. More please.
  
These trends are a result of people wanting to engage more with music. Armies of people hollering karoke and banging out "Danny Boy" on ukeleles. A wonderful thing, and I am right there hollering with them. 

How has the industry reacted to this? I haven't seen any visible reaction, but I bet they talk about it during board meetings. This sort of thing simply doesn't work well for them, millions of people making music in small intimate settings. It doesn't scale well. It's uncontrollable. It diminishes the power of celebrity culture. It gives the consumer too much self reliance, independence.

Is the music actually godawful, like I implied above? No, I didn't really mean that, just teasing. My experience has been that it can be quite good, original and interesting. Take karoke, please. The stereotype is drunk buddies egging each other on to make fools of themselves with the karoke machine. I did it, now you have to too. But people who get into it, who go week after week, get good at it. They learn how to sing.
