If music is actually a kind of human language, it should be everywhere, just like conversation with friends and family. You would think, or I would. So why is musical skill restricted to the fortunate few?

I ask my scenster buddies, wonderful large hearted people for the most part, struggling to develop their audiences, why people in their audiences don't know how to do what they do? Well I dunno; they aren't musicians. They don't have the knack, the gift. 

When people in the audience come up to me and say it must be really nice I'd love to do that, I ask them well why don't you? They often tell me that they can't. They are impaired somehow; their entire family is impaired. Besides, everyone knows it's a knack, a gift, not available to muggles.
