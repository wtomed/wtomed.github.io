DirecTV has an ad out, with a title card at the beginning "The Settlers." The main point of the ad is that cable tv is hopelessly retro, and that the modern civilized consumer should "upgrade" to satellite asap. Hokay.

But the really interesting thing about the ad is all the subtext; they really pack a lot in just 30 seconds.

The Settlers consist of Paw, Maw, daughter and son, all dressed in colorless mid nineteenth century clothing. Paw's the boss, but seems a nice enough guy. There is no modern tech anywhere, except an ancient black and white tv with a cable converter perched precariously on top. 

So without modern tech, what do Maw, Paw, Buddy, and Sis do to pass the time? They don't watch the old b&w tv.

Sis has a little faceless handmade doll to dance with.

Buddy has a wooden stick and a hoop.

Maw has a basket full of cabbages?!

Paw likes to stomp his foot. I guess that passes for music, and Sis can dance with her doll to that.

The takeaway is that folks who make their own entertainment, as opposed to sitting glommed to a wide screen hi-def tv, are hopeless rubes. 

There's a lot more going on here than cable vs satellite. It's only a matter of time before there's an ad featuring ukelele players at a karaoke bar.

The ad is totally wasted on me; it makes me shut down the computer and go play my fiddle. I wish Sis were here to dance with her doll, Buddy to run around with his hoop and stick, Maw juggling cabbages, and Paw to keep me on the beat with his foot stomping.
